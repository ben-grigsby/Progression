  <h1 class="primary-header">Welcome to My Progress Tracker</h1>
  <p class="introduction">I am currently a Junior at the University of California, Davis, studying Statistics with a concentration in Machine Learning. 
  I switched my major to Statistics ta around winter of my freshmen year. I feel like I do not have an exceptionally strong reasoning 
  for why I switched to Statistics. It is not as if I have always held a burning desire to learn statistics. In all honesty, I was like 
  most other people I have talked to, fearing the subject of statistics. I believe that it may have been that fear, along with the fact 
  that I am interested in numerous fields that resulted in me switching my major. I wanted to experience what statistics was actually like
  instead of relying on what other people had to say about it, couple this with the fact that I believed I could go into almost any field 
  with this major, resulted in my decision to switch. After almost two years, and a handful of statistics classse, I believe that I have 
  made the right choice. I am by no means a statistics or mathematics genius, notably seem from the fact that I struggled so much during 
  Spring Quarter 2024. However, despite struggling in these classes, there is still a level of satisfaction received from learning in these 
  classes, and I am still excited about how there is more to learn. I have only begun this journey and am already excited about what is to come 
  and how much there is to learn.</p>
